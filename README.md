# IMDBScraper - Organize films in folders by genre.

After backing up all of my DVDs to my hard-drive I had a neat collection of films in a 'Movie' folder, each in their own folder, but no way to put on a random thriller or horror movie if I was so inclined. IMDBScraper is a simple script that creates a folder full of genre folders, each filled with symlinks to movies of tht genre  (OSX tested). 

It takes a simple argument from the commandline, the path to the folder where your movies are stored.
